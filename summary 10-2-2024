Today, we worked on multiple aspects of your project, primarily focusing on the integration between Redis and PostgreSQL for handling data resets, saving, and retrieval within the institution evaluation system. We refactored the code to ensure that the reset functionality works seamlessly across both Redis and PostgreSQL. However, the reset still isn't fully operational, and we'll need to dig deeper into that issue tomorrow.

Key points from today:

    PostgreSQL Initialization: We ensured that the required tables are present in PostgreSQL and are correctly initialized at startup.
    Reset Functionality: We worked on improving the reset functionality by ensuring that both Redis and PostgreSQL data would be cleared properly, though we're still facing challenges in getting it to work as expected.
    Logging: We added more detailed logging for debugging purposes to track the flow of actions during data resets, table creation, and data fetching.
    General Code Cleanup: Various parts of the system were refined for better clarity and operation.

For tomorrow, we can focus on cleaning up the repository structure to make it more organized and manageable, as it's starting to get a bit cluttered. After that, we can continue troubleshooting the reset functionality and finalize other outstanding issues.

Have a great rest of your day!
